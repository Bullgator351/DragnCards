Cards in a loot pile are not in play and are under no player\u2019s control. Cards in a loot pile are considered blank, except for their cost, sphere, and card type.

After you engage an enemy with the Looter keyword, place a random card from your hand and the top X cards of your deck into that enemy\u2019s loot pile.

It was there they met Ealdwulf, one of the most powerful nobles in Rohan and chief advisor to the young Marshal \u00c9omund.\n\u201cYour warnings are dire,\u201d said Ealdwulf, sipping wine from a golden goblet. The fire crackled in his feasting-hall as the heroes and their companions conferred. \u201cAnd they are appreciated. The Marshal will hear of this immediately, and my \u00e9ored will ride at first dawn to the Anduin. They will not rest until they have avenged the sullying of our land. It is this other matter which concerns me,\u201d he said. \u201cTraitors amongst us. I have some thoughts on the matter, for the white horse on a red field is no strange symbol to the men of Aldburg. But for tonight, let us take stock and consider our options.
